  Do not setup access keys during initial user setup for all IAM users
  that have a console password
description: >
  IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is
  recommended and considered a standard security advice to grant least privilegeâ€”that is,
  granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Determine what users need to do
  and then craft policies for them that let the users perform only those tasks, instead of
  allowing full administrative privileges.
